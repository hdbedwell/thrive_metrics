# thrive_metrics
In this project, I am automating a monthly process to calculate metrics that have to be reported to a partner agency to evaluate and monitor the performance of a program.

Each month we must submit the following metrics:
#3: Number of unique students who participated in a service delivered by an SRC either in response to a crisis incident or to provide preventative service.
#3a: Number of unique students who participated in a service delivered by an SRC in response to a crisis incident #3b: Number of unique students who participated in a service delivered by an SRC in response to a preventative incident
#4: Percentage of students who participated in a service delivered by an SRC AND who have been referred to external mental health services?
#4a: Among students who have participated in a mental health session delivered by an SRC in response to a crisis incident, the percentage of students who had been referred to external mental health services.
#4b: Among students who have participated in a mental health session delivered by an SRC in response to a preventative service, the percentage of students who had been referred to external mental health services.
#5: The number of unique schools that received support from an SRC in response to a crisis or to provide a preventative service.
#5a: The number of unique schools that received support from an SRC in response to a crisis incident.
#5b: The number of unique schools that received support from an SRC in response to a preventative service.
#6: Number of unique students who have participated in an individual (1:1) mental health session delivered by an SRC in response to a crisis incident. ['individual_group']
#7: Number of uniques students who have participated in an individual (1:2+) mental health session delivered by an SRC in response to a crisis incident.
#8: Number of uniques students who have participated in an individual (1:1) mental health session delivered by an SRC in response to a preventative.
#9: Number of uniques students who have participated in an individual (1:2+) mental health session delivered by an SRC in response to a preventative.
#Number of students who have participated in an individual (1:1) mental health session delivered by an SRC up to and including the sixth week post the first preventative service. Need this for both crisis/preventative AND 1:1 / 1:2+
